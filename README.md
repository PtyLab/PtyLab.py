PtyLab is an inverse modeling toolbox for Conventional (CP) and Fourier (FP) ptychography in a unified framework. For more information please check the [paper](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-31-9-13763&id=529026).

## Getting started

The simplest way to get started is to check the below demo in Google Colab.

To explore more use cases of PtyLab, check the [example_scripts](example_scripts) and [jupyter_tutorials](jupyter_tutorials) directories. However, please install the package first as described in the below sections.

## Installation

To install the package from source,

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/PtyLab/PtyLab.py.git
```

This package uses `cupy` to utilize GPU for faster reconstruction. Please check their [instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html) for installing this dependency.

### Development
 
Please clone this repository and navigate to the root folder
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PtyLab/PtyLab.py.git
cd PtyLab.py
```

Inside a virtual environment (preferably with conda), please install `ptylab` and its dependencies from the pinned versions specified under `requirements.txt`:
```bash
conda create --name ptylab_venv python=3.11.5 # or python version satisfying ">=3.9, <3.12"
conda activate ptylab_venv
pip install -e . -r requirements.txt
```

To use the GPU, `cupy` can be additionally installed in this environment.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cupy
```

If you would like to contribute to this package, especially if it involves modifying dependencies, please checkout the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
